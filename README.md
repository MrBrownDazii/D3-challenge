### Description
This project uses D3.js to visualize state-level data information on  population health retrieved from the U.S. Census data. It similates an on-line newpaper article with an interactive visualization.  Three risk factors (obesity, smoking, and uninsurance rates) are plotted against three underlying factors which are income, poverty rate, and age.

### File Structure
- Webpage is in index.html format
- The assets folder contains everything else of relevance
- assets/css holds two styling files, styles.css and d3style.css
- assets/data holds the data set in data.csv
- assets/js holds .eslintrc.json and app.js, the latter of which runs the javascript code that contains the visualization

### Running
This project was deployed with the help of running`python -m http.server` to create the localhost:8000 using the internet broswer to access the Data Visual.
